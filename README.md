## Introduction
Stroke prediction is an important area in healthcare where machine learning techniques can be applied to analyze patient data and predict the probability of stroke occurrence. This project aims to produce a stroke prediction model that can be used by medical personnel in order to identify individuals at an increased risk of having a stroke.

The code in this repository uses a dataset of patient records, trains machine learning models, and evaluates their performance in terms of predictive accuracy. By leveraging various features such as age, gender, hypertension, heart disease, etc., the models generate predictions that can be used for risk assessment and intervention strategies.

## Features
The stroke prediction code offers the following features:
+ Preprocessing of the dataset, including handling missing values and categorical variables.
+ Feature selection to identify the most relevant predictors for stroke prediction.
+ Training of machine learning models using supervised learning techniques.
+ Evaluation of model performance using various metrics such as accuracy and F1 score.
+ Prediction of stroke probability for new, unseen patient records.

## Installation
To run the stroke prediction code locally, follow these steps:
+ Clone this repository to your local machine or download the code as a ZIP file.
+ Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
+ Place the dataset files in the project directory.

## Usage
The stroke prediction code can be used as follows:
+ Ensure that you have installed the necessary dependencies and placed the dataset file in the project directory.
+ Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
+ Run the main script using the command `python model.py`.
+ The code will preprocess the data, train the machine learning model, and generate predictions for stroke probability.
+ The results will be saved to an output file (`submission.csv`).

## Datasets
The stroke prediction code uses the real data as `healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv` dataset and synthetic datas as `train.csv`, `test.csv`, which contains anonymized patient records with various attributes such as age, gender, hypertension, heart disease, etc. The dataset is included in this repository for convenience.

## Model
The stroke prediction code implements a machine learning model. The model is trained using the dataset and evaluated for its predictive performance.
You can find the model implementation details in the `models.py` file.

## Result
The code outputs the predictions for stroke probability, along with various evaluation metrics, such as accuracy and F1 score. The results are displayed in the console during runtime and are also saved to the `predictions.csv` file.
